# specs/

This directory stores planner-owned technical specs for autonomous execution.

Recommended structure:
- `specs/<topic>-overview.md`
- `specs/<topic>-acceptance.md`
- `specs/<topic>-rollout.md`

Guidelines:
- Keep specs concise and testable.
- Reference exact files/components impacted.
- Escalate high-impact unknowns as `decision/major`.
